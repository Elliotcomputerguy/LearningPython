# Indexing is the adding of a square bracket to the end of a string value or a variable containing a string with a number 
# between them. This number is called the index, and tells python which postion in the string has the character you want. 
# The index of the first character in a string is 0. The index 1 is the second character, etc. 

var = 'Elliot'
print(var[0],var[1],var[2],var[3],var[4],var[5])
var = 'Elliot'[0]
print(var)

# #Negative Indexes
# Negative indexes start at the end of a string and go backwards. The negative index -1 is the index of the last character in a string. 
# The index -2 is the index of the second from last character, and so on. 

var = 'Elliot'
print(var[-1],var[-2],var[-3],var[-4],var[-5], var[-6])
