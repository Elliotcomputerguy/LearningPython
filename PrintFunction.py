# There is another python instruction called a print() function call. It performs a task to print values to the screen.
# There are many different functions that come with Python. To call a function means to execute the code that is inside
# the function parenthesis().
# A value that is passed into the function call are called arguments. Arguments are the same as values but are only called 
# arguments when they are passed to function calls. You can also pass an expression to the print() function call instead of a
# single value. This is because the value that is actually passed to the print() function is the evaluated value of that expression.

var = 'Elliot'
print('Hello, ' + var)
