# Methods are just like functions, except they are attached to a non-module value with a period.

# A function is not a method just because it is in a module. It can some times get confusing. Example; pyperclip.copy() is not a method but
# indeed a module. It is a function that is inside the pyperclip module. Most data types like strings have methods.
